# Better Coop Item Pedestals
Better Coop Item Pedestals is a mod for *[The Binding of Isaac: Repentance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/)*, written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using the [IsaacScript](https://isaacscript.github.io/) framework.

Designed to improve the muliplayer coop experience, this mod changes item pedestals to behave the same as they do in boss rooms: one item spawn per player.
# Features
* Automatic scaling of item spawns to the number of players.
* Only one item is shown to the players at a time, just like in boss rooms.
* Support for items that modify pedestal behavior, such as: Damocles, Diplopia, More Options, and There's Options.
* Support for most room types: treasure and planetarium rooms are enabled by default.
* Active item prevention, ensuring that only the last item to spawn has a chance to be an active item.
* A fix for Void and Abyss in coop, ensuring that the entire pedestal is not removed if there are additional items to spawn.
* Many customizable options and settings to tailor the experience to your liking.
